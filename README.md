- 👋 Hi, I’m Suneye Holmes. My first name is pronounced "sunny!" I adopted this tag - @rogue-economista - many moons ago.
- 👀 I’m interested in economic research on topics in Health and on the Environment. I am also interested in using economics to study connections between Africa and African America.
- 🌱 I’m currently a third-year Economics PhD student at Georgia Tech pursuing an independent minor in Global Health.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on brainstorming ideas, coding and workflow efficiency.
- 📫 I also teach economics full-time at my alma mater, Spelman College. sholmes34@gatech.edu or sholmes@spelman.edu
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
